/*
In Quartus Prime for MAX 10 devices, you can obtain the functionality of the `IOBUF` primitive using a combination of WIRE and TRI primitives.
The `WIRE` primitive is used to define an intermediate signal, and the `TRI` primitive is used to control the tri-state behavior of the signal.

In this Verilog module, we define an `io_buffer` module that provides the functionality of the `IOBUF` primitive for MAX 10 devices. It includes an input `I`, an inout bidirectional I/O `IO`, and an output `O`. Additionally, there is a `T` input, which controls the tri-state enable functionality.

Here's how the module works:

1. The input `I` is assigned to an intermediate wire `i_wire`, which acts as the input to the buffer.
2. For the bidirectional buffer, the `IO` is assigned to either the intermediate wire `i_wire` or tri-stated (1'bz) based on the `T` input.
3. For the output buffer, the intermediate wire `o_wire` is assigned the value of `IO` or tri-stated (1'bz) based on the `T` input.
   Finally, the output `O` takes the value of `o_wire`.

The `T` input can be driven externally to control the tri-state enable behavior of the buffer. When `T` is high, the buffer is tri-stated, and both the input and output signals are in a high-impedance state. When `T` is low, the buffer functions normally, allowing data to be driven from the input to the output.

module as_io_buffer (
    inout IO,   // Bidirectional I/O signal
    input I,    // Input to the buffer
    input T,    // Tri-state enable signal
    output O    // Output from the buffer
);

    wire i_wire;
    wire o_wire;

    // Assign the input to the buffer to the intermediate wire
    assign i_wire = I;

    // Bidirectional buffer: input to the wire when not tri-stated
    assign IO = T ? 1'bz : i_wire;

    // Output buffer: output from the wire when not tri-stated
    assign o_wire = IO;
    assign O = T ? 1'bz : o_wire;
